# 3BTRON: A Blood-Brain Barrier Recognition Network

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/930454393.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15682541)

This is the repository associated with the paper "[3BTRON: A Blood-Brain Barrier Recognition Network](https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-025-08453-6)". 

## Files

Here, we provide a description of the files made available in this repository.

### The Model

To promote the sharing of resources, we provide the trained model described in the paper, optimised for the PyTorch framework (3BTRON.pt).

### Scripts

This folder contains all associated code (including scripts for data pre-processing, training and evaluation, stratification and for generating and visualising GradCAM heatmaps).

### Data

The data presented in this study can be found on Zenodo at: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14845497.

### Experiments

Code for experiments and figures presented in this study will be made available by the corresponding author upon reasonable request. 

## Set-up

For this, you will need to have conda installed (find more information here: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)

Before creating the environment, you will need to update your base environment. If you don't do this, you will receive a numpy error when trying to load and run the model. Update your base environment in your terminal:
```python
conda update --all
```

Now, still in the terminal, you can create the environment from the environment.yml file:
```python
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Activate the environment: 
```python
conda activate img-classification
```

Verify that the environment was installed correctly:
```python
conda env list
```

## Loading the Model

To generate outputs on your own data, you will first need to load the model before setting the model to evaluation mode. In a new Jupyter notebook, run the following:
```python
import torch
from torchvision import models
from scripts.model import mixedresnetnetwork

device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
resnet50 = models.resnet50(weights='DEFAULT')
model = mixedresnetnetwork(model=resnet50, embeddings=resnet50.fc.in_features)

SAVE_END_MODEL=True

if SAVE_END_MODEL:
	# for this to work, your notebook must be saved in the same folder as '3BTRON.pt' and the 'scripts' folder.
	# depending on your machine, comment out the line you don't need
    ## if using a gpu
    model.load_state_dict(torch.load('./3BTRON.pt')) 
    ## if running on a CPU-only machine
    model.load_state_dict(torch.load('./3BTRON.pt', map_location=torch.device('cpu'))) 

model = model.to(device)
model.eval()
```
For worked examples of how to run the model on your own data, you can use the notebooks provided above. For working with labelled data, use 'generate_outputs_labelled.ipynb' or for unlabelled data, use 'generate_outputs_unlabelled.ipynb'. Note, your data must be pre-processed as in the 'preprocessing.py' script. Depending on whether your data is labelled or unlabelled, the appropriate functions are denoted by inline comments. 

To fine-tune the model on your own data, you will need to set the model to training mode using:
```python
model.train()
```
To adapt the model to your own data, you will need to retrain the model from scratch.
